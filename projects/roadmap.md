# Python Expert Roadmap

## 1. Master the Basics
- Python syntax and indentation
- Data types: int, float, str, bool, list, tuple, set, dict
- Variables and basic operators
- Control flow: if, elif, else, for, while
- Functions and scope
- Input/output

## 2. Practice Regularly
- Complete exercises after each lesson
- Build small scripts and mini-projects

## 3. Learn Advanced Topics
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism
- Modules and packages
- File handling (read/write files)
- Exception handling (try/except)
- Comprehensions (list, dict, set)
- Lambda, map, filter, reduce
- Decorators and generators

## 4. Explore Python Libraries
- Standard library: os, sys, datetime, math, random, collections
- Data science: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
- Web development: Flask, Django
- Automation: requests, BeautifulSoup, selenium
- Testing: unittest, pytest

## 5. Algorithms and Data Structures
- Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Recursion and dynamic programming
- Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank

## 6. Build Real-World Projects
- Start with simple apps (calculator, to-do list)
- Move to complex projects (web apps, data analysis, automation)
- Document your code and use version control (git)

## 7. Contribute and Collaborate
- Read and contribute to open source projects
- Review code written by others
- Stay updated with new Python features (PEP, official docs)

## 8. Keep Practicing and Learning
- Join Python communities (Reddit, Stack Overflow, Discord)
- Attend workshops, webinars, and hackathons
- Never stop building and experimenting!
