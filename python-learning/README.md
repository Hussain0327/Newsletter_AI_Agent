# Python Learning Roadmap

Welcome to your Python learning and practice space! This area is organized to help you learn Python step by step, practice your skills, and build your own projects.

## Structure

- `guided-lessons/` — Follow step-by-step lessons to learn Python concepts.
- `practice-exercises/` — Practice what you learn with exercises and challenges.
- `projects/` — Build your own Python projects, from simple to advanced.

## Suggested Roadmap

1. **Start with Guided Lessons**
   - Work through the lessons in order.
   - Each lesson introduces a new concept with explanations and examples.
2. **Practice Regularly**
   - Try the exercises after each lesson.
   - Challenge yourself with extra problems.
3. **Build Projects**
   - Start with small projects.
   - Gradually try more complex ideas as you learn.
