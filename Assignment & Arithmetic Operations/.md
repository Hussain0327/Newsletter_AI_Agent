## 1. Variable in Python


In Python, a **variable** is a symbolic name that you can use to reference a value. Variables are used to store data, which can be of various types like numbers(int,float), strings, boolean, lists, dictionary etc. Once a value is assigned to a variable, you can use that variable to access or manipulate the value.


### Important Characteristics about variables in Python:

   
1. **Assignment**: You use the `=` operator to assign a value to a variable.
   ```python
   z = 3.14  # z is a float
   ```
3. **Reassignment**: You can reassign a variable to a new value or even a new type.
   ```python
   x = 10
   x = "Now I'm a string"  # x is now a string
   ```

4. **Multiple Assignments**: You can assign multiple variables in one line.
   ```python
   a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
   ```

### Variable Naming Rules


- **Allowed Characters**: Variable names can include the following:
  - Lowercase letters: `a` through `z`
  - Uppercase letters: `A` through `Z`
  - Underscore: `_`
  - Digits: `0` through `9`

- **Starting Characters**:
  - Names **cannot** begin with a digit.
  - Names **can** start with an uppercase letter or an underscore, but it’s recommended to avoid this practice.

- **Multiple-Word Names**:
  - Use either the underscore (`_`) as a delimiter or adopt camelCase capitalization.

- **Meaningful Names**:
  - Choose meaningful names to enhance the readability of your program, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand.

### Variable Types

In Python, variables do not require an explicit type declaration—types are determined automatically when you assign a value.
They can be broadly categorized into **basic (primitive) types** and **collection (non-primitive) types**.


**1. Basic (Primitive) Types:** These store single values.

| Type      | Description                                   | Example            |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `int`     | Integer numbers (no decimal)                  | `x = 10`           |
| `float`   | Decimal numbers (floating point)              | `pi = 3.14`        |
| `bool`    | Boolean values (`True` or `False`)            | `is_active = True` |
| `str`     | Text (sequence of Unicode characters)         | `name = "Alice"`   |

**2. Collection (Non-Primitive) Types:** These store multiple values.

| Type        | Description                         | Example                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `list`      | Ordered, mutable sequence           | `nums = [1, 2, 3]`                    |
| `tuple`     | Ordered, immutable sequence         | `coords = (4, 5)`                     |
| `set`       | Unordered, mutable, unique elements | `colors = {"red", "blue"}`            
| `dict`      | Key-value pairs (mutable)           | `person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}` |

**3. Special Types:** `NoneType` → represents the absence of a value:

  ```python
  x = None
  ```

## 2. Assignment Operations

In Python, assignment operations are used to assign values to variables. They are fundamental to programming as they enable you to store and manipulate data. The assignment operator (=) is use to assign the value.

# Assigning an `int` Value to a Variable

a = 10
print(a)  # Output: 10
print(type(a))  # the type function returns the type of the variable

# Assigning a `float` Value to a Variable

b = 10.10
print(b)  # Output: 10.1
print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'float'>

# Assigning a `String` Value to a Variable
# Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. Python allows you to create strings using single (`'`), double (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`). Triple quotes are useful for multi-line strings.

a1 = "Hello Jamez"
print(a1)  # Output: Hello Jamez

a2 = 'Hello Jamez'
print(a2)  # Output: Hello Jamez

a3 = """Hello Jamez"""
print(a3)  # Output: Hello Jamez

a4 = '''Hello Jamez'''
print(a4)  # Output: Hello Jamez

x='10'
print(type(x))

# Assigning a `Boolean` Value to a Variable

x = True
print(x)  # Output: True
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

y = False
print(y)  # Output: False
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'bool'>

## 3. Simple Arithmetic Operations

x=3
y=5
result = x+y
print(result)  # Output: 8

result = 10 - 4
print(result)  # Output: 6

result = 7 * 2
print(result)  # Output: 14

result = 10 / 2
print(result)  # Output: 5.0

## 4. Special Arithmatic Operations

1. **Floor Division (`//`)**
   Floor division takes two numbers and divides them, but instead of giving you the exact result, it only gives you the whole number part, ignoring anything after the decimal point.
   
2. **Modulus (`%`)**
   The modulus operation finds the remainder left over after dividing one number by another.

3. **Exponentiation (` **`)**
   Exponentiation raises one number to the power of another. This means multiplying the base number by itself a certain number of times.

result = 11 // 3
print(result)  # Output: 3

result = 10 % 3
print(result)  # Output: 1

result = 2 ** 3
print(result)  # Output: 8

## 5. Commenting Python Code

In Python, comments are written using the `#` symbol for single-line comments. Any text following the `#` will be ignored by Python.

For multi-line comments, you can use a string literal enclosed in triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`). While these aren't technically comments, they're often used in the same way because Python ignores them unless they are used as docstrings (which describe functions or classes).


**Single-line comment:**
```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is an inline comment
```

**Multi-line comment:**
```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment or string literal.
It is commonly used for comments that span multiple lines.
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

Note that for multi-line comments, it is more common to use `#` on each line:
```python
# This is a comment
# that spans
# multiple lines
```
